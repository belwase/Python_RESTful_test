Welcome to the Python RESTful API test
======================================


The objetive of this test if to help us evalute your skills with:

* Problem Solving
* Web Server API Design
* Request-time data manipulation
* Testing strategies
* Deployment

**Instructions**

* Fork the repo into a private repo.
* Create a virtualenv for this project and install requirements.txt file
* Modify the main module to complete the required API endpoints
* Let us know when you have finished.

**Tasks**

The idea here is for us to see how you design a minimalistic API. This API will be 
used to perform CRUD operations on a model called User.

You're free to design this model as you want, but, at a minimum should have:

* ID
* First name
* Last name
* Latitude
* Longitude

Check the main.py file, there you'll see you have to fullfill the following empty edges:

```python
@app.route('/prt/api/v1.0/users', methods=['GET'])
@auth.login_required
def get_users():
    """
    Update this to return a json stream defining a listing of the users
    Note: Always return the appropriate response for the action requested.
    """
    return jsonify({})


@app.route('/prt/api/v1.0/users/<int:user_id>', methods=['GET'])
@auth.login_required
def get_user(user_id):
    return jsonify({})


@app.route('/prt/api/v1.0/users', methods=['POST'])
@auth.login_required
def create_user():
    """
    Should add a new user to the users collection, with validation
    note: Always return the appropriate response for the action requested.
    """
    return jsonify({})


@app.route('/prt/api/v1.0/users/<int:user_id>', methods=['PUT'])
@auth.login_required
def update_user(user_id):
    """
    Update user specified with user ID and return updated user contents
    Note: Always return the appropriate response for the action requested.
    """
    return jsonify({})


@app.route('/todo/api/v1.0/users/<int:user_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
@auth.login_required
def delete_user(user_id):
    """
    Delete user specified in user ID
    Note: Always return the appropriate response for the action requested.
    """
    return jsonify({})

@app.route('/todo/api/v1.0/distances', methods=['GET'])
@auth.login_required
def get_distances(user_id):
    """
    Each user has a lat/lon associated with them.  Determine the distance
    between each user pair, and provide the min/max/average/std as a json response.
    This should be GET only.
    You can use numpy or whatever suits you
    """
    return jsonify({})
```

This should be self-explanatory, we want you to fulfill the missing logic to generate expected 
responses.

It is important that you return correct response codes.


**Notes**

* The boilerplate code assumes you will use Flask, please stick to this
* Feel free to use any approach to deliver us the code..hint: A big bonus if you give us a Dockerfile we can just boot up and see application working
* Indicate what testing approach are you using...TDD, write code and test later, mocking, and tell us how to test your code
* Using MongoDB is required to store and retrieve data, you can use Flask-PyMongo or PyMongo, it is up to you.
* Try to adhere to Python etiquette (idiomatic and PEP-8 compliant code)
* For the distances endpoint, feel free to use any approach, although numpy will be highly beneficial here
* There is no need to write front-end code, but if you want to show off, build something that shows us your Angular-fu and 
makes our jaw drop, but only if you have extra time, this is not mandatory

**Questions**

* About the distances endpoint, please explain how would you scale this to hundreds and thousands of petitions per second, 
considering this is a CPU intensive endpoint. 
```
 Since there is not any input parameter on this api and we'll be responding with same response 
 (from same users in db). I think we can cache calculations for existing users in in-memory db. and for the request which has new users added, we can again calculate using cached value with new users. This way it will be fast for millions of petitions per seconds.
```
* How would you apporach this if latitude and longitude of user would be changing very frequently as well?  
```
in this case we can do partial caching to calculate only changed users, use some smart algorithms to calculate fast (or calculating from db itself), may go for cpython or numba which are lower level binding near to C, sometime way may need to scale infrastructure
```


**Deliverable**

Publish your work in a GitHub repository. Please use Python 3.x for your coding. Feel free to modify this readme to give any additional information a reviewer might need.
If you need more than 2 - 3 hours to do this, you might be overthinking, feel free to add improvement notes in your README file, show-off there :)
